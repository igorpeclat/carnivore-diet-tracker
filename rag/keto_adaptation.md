# Keto Adaptation

## What is Keto Adaptation?
The metabolic transition from glucose-burning to fat-burning (ketosis).
On carnivore, this happens naturally due to near-zero carbs.

## Timeline

### Week 1-2: Transition Phase
- Body depleting glycogen stores
- Electrolyte shifts
- Possible "keto flu" symptoms
- Energy fluctuations

### Week 3-4: Early Adaptation
- Ketone production increasing
- Energy stabilizing
- Mental clarity improving
- Cravings reducing

### Month 2-3: Full Adaptation
- Fat-adapted metabolism
- Stable energy all day
- Enhanced mental clarity
- Physical performance recovering

### Month 6+: Deep Adaptation
- Optimal fat oxidation
- Peak cognitive benefits
- Metabolic flexibility

## Signs of Adaptation
- No energy crashes
- Can skip meals easily
- Stable mood
- Clear thinking
- Good sleep
- No carb cravings

## What Slows Adaptation
- Hidden carbs
- Inconsistency
- Too much protein (gluconeogenesis)
- Stress
- Poor sleep

## Accelerating Adaptation
- Stay strictly carnivore
- Adequate fat intake
- Proper electrolytes
- Good sleep
- Moderate exercise
